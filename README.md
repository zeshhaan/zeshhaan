### hello ðŸ‘‹

I am a programmer who is in love with Functional Programming. I am someone who is defined by a constant thirst to learn. No matter how much time I spend learning new technologies, and no matter how much I invest in the growth of my knowledge, I can never seem to quench that thirst!

I love Elixir and plan to learn and involve more into it. I like to learn new things by implementing them on side projects and getting involved in related communities. I'm currently being mentored by the awesome [@BrooklinJazz](https://github.com/BrooklinJazz) while being an early tester on [DockYard Academy](https://dockyard.com/blog/2022/07/26/what-to-expect-from-the-dockyard-academy-q-a-with-instructor-brooklin-myers).

I work at [@foodmarkethub](https://foodmarkethub.com/) where we're building a digital platform in F&B space to connect restaurants to their suppliers to achieve better food costs and consolidate backend operations. If you or your relatives/friends own a restaurant within APAC, definitely recommend checking us out!  

During weekends, I can be seen working on freelance projects or helping folks to get into tech or even taking a course or sometimes attending a virtual event.
